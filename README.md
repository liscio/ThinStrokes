# ThinStrokes

Forces text to draw using "Thin Strokes" as applied in iTerm 2 for retina displays. Bask in all its crisp glory!

In a nutshell, the `NSLayoutManager` class is swizzled to force drawing with an undocumented smoothing mode, as done by iTerm in the following code:

This is probably a horrible idea, but it's way easier on the eyes!
